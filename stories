Timeouts should be honored
Server unavailable should be recognized
Server and client should sync time in the beginning (simple /_time_diff?now=foo) 
Clients should be able to create channels dynamically


Philosophy:
1) You never know if another hub is online or not, but each hub has a lastSeen attribute.
